Simple Django cookiecutter
==========================

*Warning: For python 2.7.x.*

This cookiecutter has LDAP authentication configured - if you don't want it you need to remove the lines



Usage:

```
mkdir parent_folder
cd parent_folder
virtualenv venv
cookiecutter https://github.com/spapas/cookiecutter-django-starter
```

Now answer the questions - the most important is the project name.

```
cd project_name
dovenv.bat
pip install -r requirements\dev.txt

```
